# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Temporary-Secure-Environment-for-Public-Terminals-
A Temporary Secure Environment (TSE) for Public Terminals involves providing a secure and isolated session for a user on a shared/public terminal (e.g., cyber cafes, libraries).
The "Temporary Secure Environment for Public Terminals" project aims to create a secure and ephemeral workspace that ensures users can access public computers without leaving behind any trace of their activities. This concept is especially useful in public settings like libraries, internet cafes, kiosks, or airports, where multiple users share the same machines.

Key Features and Concepts:
Ephemeral Workspace:

Ephemeral means temporary or short-lived. This workspace ensures that once the user logs out or finishes their session, all data related to their activities (files, browsing history, login credentials, etc.) is wiped clean. The system returns to its pristine state, ready for the next user.
This ensures privacy and security, as no personal data is stored, reducing the risk of data leakage or theft.
Session Isolation:

Each user session is isolated from others. This prevents one user from accessing or tampering with the data of another user.
This could be implemented using containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtualization (e.g., VirtualBox), where each user session runs in a separate, secure container or virtual machine.
Data Wiping and Privacy Protection:

Once the user finishes their session, any data generated during the session, such as documents, web history, cached files, and logs, is securely wiped.
This involves:
File deletion: Using tools like shred (Linux) or other secure deletion methods.
Disk wiping: Ensuring that no data remains in free space on the disk (using tools like wipe or DBAN).
This is crucial in preventing forensic recovery of deleted data, which could be a security vulnerability in a shared public system.
Secure Login and Authentication:

Secure Login: The public terminals should implement a secure login system, such as:
Temporary usernames/passwords.
One-time passwords (OTPs) sent via SMS or email.
Biometric authentication (fingerprints or facial recognition) if possible.
This ensures that only authorized users can access the system and reduces the chances of unauthorized use.
User Data Encryption:

Any sensitive data that users may temporarily store on the system should be encrypted. If the data must be stored temporarily (e.g., for a session), encryption will ensure that unauthorized parties cannot access it, even if they somehow gain access to the machine.
Automatic Environment Reset:

After each user logs out, the system should automatically reset to its original state. This means:
Configuration settings revert to their default state.
Temporary files (including browser cache, downloads, and documents) are deleted.
Network connections (like Wi-Fi) are reset.
This can be achieved using system restore points or scripts that automatically clean up after each session.
Malware Protection and Monitoring:

Implement basic anti-malware protection to prevent the installation or execution of malicious software during a user session. This can be done by using OS-level security tools or lightweight virus scanners that run in the background.
Additionally, the system can log activities for security monitoring to detect any suspicious activities or attempts to bypass security measures.
Access Control and Restrictions:

Certain system functionalities (such as accessing system files or installing software) should be restricted to prevent users from tampering with the system or gaining unauthorized access to other users’ data.
Restrict users’ ability to perform system-level operations by using permissions management and sandboxing techniques.
Key Technologies You Might Use:
Operating System:

Linux-based operating systems are ideal for this kind of project because of their flexibility and security features. Lightweight Linux distributions like Ubuntu or even dedicated live distributions like Tails (a privacy-focused OS) might be considered.
Windows is also an option but might be more challenging to manage security and isolation.
Containerization:

Docker: You could use Docker to create isolated containers for each user session. Docker allows the system to create isolated environments where each user’s session runs independently. Once the user logs out, the container can be destroyed or reset.
Virtualization:

VirtualBox or VMware can be used to create a virtual machine (VM) for each user session. The VM can be configured to reset automatically after each use, ensuring no trace of the previous session remains.
Data Wiping:

Use tools like shred (for Linux) or DBAN (for disk wiping) to ensure that all traces of user data are securely erased after each session.
Implement a custom script to clean up temporary files, history, and browser cache after each session.
Secure Authentication:

Use OAuth or OpenID Connect for temporary user login with single sign-on features.
Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.
Encryption:

Implement AES encryption for any data that needs to be temporarily stored on disk. OpenSSL can help with this encryption process.
Monitoring and Logs:

Set up a logging system that records events like user logins, data wiping, or security alerts, ensuring that administrators can monitor system activity without compromising user privacy.
Implementation Outline:
Design the Architecture:

Decide between containerization or virtualization for user session isolation.
Choose the OS and software stack (e.g., Linux, Docker/VMware, and secure file deletion tools).
Develop Session Management:

Write scripts or programs that handle user login, session initiation, and session termination.
Set up the system to wipe data and reset after each session automatically.
Implement Security Measures:

Secure user authentication, ensuring that no personal data is stored permanently.
Implement network isolation and malware protection.
Data Wiping and Cleanup:

Set up automatic cleaning scripts that remove temporary files, history, and cached data.
Ensure proper disk erasure techniques are in place.
Testing:

Conduct unit and security testing on individual components (data erasure, login system, etc.).
Test the entire system under various scenarios to ensure all user data is wiped and the system is secure.
Deploy and Monitor:

Deploy the system to a public terminal environment.
Set up real-time monitoring for potential security breaches or system failures.
Final Thoughts:
The Temporary Secure Environment for Public Terminals project is an excellent way to address privacy concerns and improve security for shared computing spaces. By implementing the features outlined above, you’ll create a system where users can access public PCs without worrying about leaving behind personal data or compromising their security.
