# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-Temporary-Secure-Environment-for-Public-Terminals-
A Temporary Secure Environment (TSE) for Public Terminals involves providing a secure and isolated session for a user on a shared/public terminal (e.g., cyber cafes, libraries).
The "Temporary Secure Environment for Public Terminals" project aims to create a secure and ephemeral workspace that ensures users can access public computers without leaving behind any trace of their activities. This concept is especially useful in public settings like libraries, internet cafes, kiosks, or airports, where multiple users share the same machines.

Key Features and Concepts:
Ephemeral Workspace:

Ephemeral means temporary or short-lived. This workspace ensures that once the user logs out or finishes their session, all data related to their activities (files, browsing history, login credentials, etc.) is wiped clean. The system returns to its pristine state, ready for the next user.
This ensures privacy and security, as no personal data is stored, reducing the risk of data leakage or theft.
Session Isolation:

Each user session is isolated from others. This prevents one user from accessing or tampering with the data of another user.
This could be implemented using containerization (e.g., Docker) or virtualization (e.g., VirtualBox), where each user session runs in a separate, secure container or virtual machine.
Data Wiping and Privacy Protection:

Once the user finishes their session, any data generated during the session, such as documents, web history, cached files, and logs, is securely wiped.
This involves:
File deletion: Using tools like shred (Linux) or other secure deletion methods.
Disk wiping: Ensuring that no data remains in free space on the disk (using tools like wipe or DBAN).
This is crucial in preventing forensic recovery of deleted data, which could be a security vulnerability in a shared public system.
